# PlexPreConverter
An application I threw together that basically uses HandbrakeCLI to recursivly convert videos.

It's specifically useful for converting files that Plex would normally need to convert for most players into H264/MP3 videos in the MP4 container
which will allow just about any plex client device to play said video without the plex server having to do any conversion itself.

This makes a media server on say a Raspberry Pi, Significantly more useful.
